# DocPlannerproject 
In this Project, we will reproduce the docplanner clone  website using HTML and CSS.

Here is a link to the site: https://www.docplanner.com/.
I wish, you'll find the following instructions helpful.
This repository holds the Html and CSS source code of the  docplanner clone, the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production. It exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Html and CSS.
